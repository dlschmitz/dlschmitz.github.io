                <p>I chose the Apple website because they use a lot of white space on their page.
                    While I am not a big Apple fan, I do appreciate and admire how they can successfully make the white space on the page desireable.
                    They also have a very clean look to their images and the flow of the page.</p>

                <p>Dropbox is a site that I have used in the past as a free service. 
                    I chose this site because they regularly promote signing up for their services.
                    If we look at the screenshot there are three different ways a person can sign up for their paid service.

                <img src="images/Netflix_contrast.jpg" alt="Netflix Contrast from the login to the background">
                <p>Netflix offers a very impressive background on the login page.
                    They promote all of the many of the popular movies and shows they currently have available.
                    They also have a strong white font that directs the eyes to signing up or logging in to the site.
